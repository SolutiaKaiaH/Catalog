Controller handles requests from the client 

204 response from swagger
    - something is not as expected 
    - the problem was that every time we called our ItemsController
        we were creating a new List items with all new
        generated .NewGuid Id's

Dependency Injection
    - a class that wants to use another class   
        - this class is a dependancy (depends on that class)
    - instead of having our Controller create a new instance
        we want to receive a repository into the controller (inject)
        and use this. 
    - Why?
        - by having our code depend upon abstractions we are decoupling
            implementations from each other
        - Code is cleaner, easier to modify and easier to requests
    - HOW TO CONSTRUCT
        - using an IServiceProvider
        - register each dependancy into the provider and it will
            resolve any dependancies needed and construct and
            inject dependcncies
